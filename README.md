# Factorio SAT
Enhancing the Factorio experience with SAT solvers.

![](/pictures/diagram.png)

## How it works
 * A balancer size is selected
 * Tiles get represented as a list of boolean (true/false) variables (input direction, output direction, underground state, splitter side, splitter id, colour)
 * Clauses (rules/constraints) are written to restrict solutions to only valid balancers:
   * Belts don't intersect
   * Colour along a belt is consistent
   * The ends of the balancer have the correct input/output colours
   * For each splitter in the splitter network, there are splitters in the solution that have the same input/output colours as the abstract network splitter
 * Clauses are passed into a SAT solver which either returns the solution or proves there is no solution
 * If no solution is found then a new size is selected

## Caveats
 * Currently uses the assumption that the inputs/outputs of the balancer need to be covered by splitters. This should result in balancers that are within 1 tile of optimal and in practice no balancers have been found that exhibit this worst case.
 * There is no proof that the clauses generated by this program are consistent with the rules of Factorio
 * Generating balancers gets exponentially harder as more splitters are added to the network. At least until someone proves P = NP

## Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Get textures
cd assets
python fetch.py /path/to/factorio/install

# Factorio install directory should look something like:
# Factorio/
# ├── bin/
# ├── data/
# │   ├── base/
# │   ├── core/
# │   ...
# ...
```
For rendering splitter networks `graphviz` needs to be installed. This can be done via a package manager or with the lastest install package available at [https://graphviz.org/download/](https://graphviz.org/download/#windows).

## TODO
 * Solve the remaining balancers (8 to 7, 7 to 5, 5 to 7, 8 to 5, 7 to 8, 5 to 8)
 * Go bigger
 * Add support for finding the optimal factory units
